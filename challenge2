#Coding Efficiency Challenge 2
use_synth :piano
x=21 #the first note of the piano is A0 which is number 21. So I stared with it
87. times do #the piano ends C8 which is 108. The distance between 21 to 108 is 87. So i am looping it 87 times
  play x #its gonna x which will start with the lowest sound
  sleep 0.25 #it will sleep/pause for 0.25
  x=(x+1) #as the loop ends, i am going to add 1 more bumber to x so it plays the next sound until it reaches 108
end
